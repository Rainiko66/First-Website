            <h2>Background & Vision Overview</h2>
            <p>One example of bias in algorithmic hiring is from the multinational e-commerce company, Amazon. Amazon's recruitment tool was suspended after the AI system they built was found to be biased against women due to the number of hired men outweighing the number of hired women in the data. The dataset failed to provide sufficient information for the algorithm to learn from because of the predominantly male resumes over a 10-year period.

                Dataset imbalances, representative bias, data mismatch, etc, are all common problems that businesses face in integrating AI systems into their business models. We plan to give a comprehensive solution to solve biases in data, using the right method to train and test a model, and using the right metrics for evaluating a model. We also plan to give solutions for integrating AI systems that are able to aid and collaborate with human employees in their decision-making skills.
